Welcome to the Rails Supplemental Guide. This was made by the mentors of Bloc to make the learning process easier. We hope this helps!

### Common Problems

Is there anything I need to submit?

* Nope, not necessarily. If you have any questions feel free to ask them in the discussion or submission box, or the preferred style of communication between yoyou and your mentor. Just make sure you read and understand the expectations under the Assignment tab!
