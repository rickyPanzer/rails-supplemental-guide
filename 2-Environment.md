## Hint

#### Ignore the assignment
* It tells you to install Virtual Box, along with Ubuntu and Rails Girls on it
* Realistically you might need to do this in future. When it's time for you to do it, you'll be able to. For now, it's a huge time suck and not the best use of time as new student to the Rails curriculum
